Demo files for the ReactJS Lunch and Learn event I'm hosting in March, 2017.
This project uses NodeJS, NPM, webpack, and obviously ReactJS to separately build a series of frontend micro-apps to demonstrate some of the basics beginners will need to master to get started with ReactJS.

Using:
npm 3.3.12
node 5.4.1

For additional dependency information, check this project's package.json file.
